# Hi there, I'm Shristi Muskan ðŸ‘‹

[cite_start]I'm a third-year Information Technology undergraduate at the National Institute of Technology, Srinagar, with a deep focus on systems programming and computer architecture[cite: 5, 9].

I'm fascinated by the magic that happens at the intersection of hardware and software. This curiosity drives me to not just use computer systems, but to build their fundamental components from the ground up. [cite_start]I recently created **[Lash](link-to-your-lash-project-page.md)**, a Unix-like shell written in C++, to explore core OS concepts and low-level development[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Currently, I'm diving even deeper into the stack by designing a **[RISC-V32 CPU](link-to-your-risc-v-project-page.md)** in VHDL, turning digital logic into a processor that can execute code[cite: 6].

[cite_start]With a strong foundation in C, C++, VHDL, and Linux, I'm passionate about solving complex, low-level challenges[cite: 43]. I'm currently seeking a challenging systems internship where I can contribute to building robust, efficient software and learn from experienced engineers.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me:
